Agri-Link is an agri-commerce mobile app that connects farmers, customers, and delivery riders for easier access to fresh produce and fairer agricultural trade.
Farmers can easily showcase and sell their produce, while customers can discover fresh farm goods, place orders, and pay securely.
The app also includes a rider feature, allowing delivery personnel to sign up and receive requests, helping ensure that fresh produce gets to customers quickly and reliably.

Agri-Link helps support local farmers, eliminates middleman costs, improves access to fresh food, and creates new job opportunities through its delivery network.
